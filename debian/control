Description: remote incremental backup
 rdiff-backup backs up one directory to another, possibly over a network. The
 target directory ends up a copy of the source directory, but extra reverse
 diffs are stored in a special subdirectory of that target directory, so you can
 still recover files lost some time ago. The idea is to combine the best
 features of a mirror and an incremental backup. rdiff-backup also preserves
 subdirectories, hard links, dev files, permissions, uid/gid ownership,
 modification times, extended attributes, acls, and resource forks.
 .
 Also, rdiff-backup can operate in a bandwidth efficient manner over a pipe,
 like rsync. Thus you can use rdiff-backup and ssh to securely back a hard drive
 up to a remote location, and only the differences will be transmitted. Finally,
 rdiff-backup is easy to use and settings have sensible defaults.
